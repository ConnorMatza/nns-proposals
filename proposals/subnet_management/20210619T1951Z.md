Problem: When serializing/deserializing CanisterStateBits, we stored IC_00 in the controller field of pb::CanisterStateBits for forward-compability in the cases where there is no controller. When deserializing, however, IC_00 was erroneously added to the legitimate list of controllers.

Solution: Now that we have canisters in the production with IC_00 as their controller, this PR:

Removes IC_00 from the controllers list of canisters. We can assume no one explicitly set IC_00 as their controller.
Use a NO_CONTROLLER_MARKER instead of IC_00 for clarity.
Update the deserializing logic to not add IC_00 or the NO_CONTROLLER_MARKER back to the list of controllers.
