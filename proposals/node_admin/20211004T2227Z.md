Bless replica version to commit b099ca45f21dc84d9f9dd6d14cc8cb4e7c00e3e1.

The last blessed revision `3eaf8541c389badbd6cd50fff31e158505f4487d` did NOT get deployed to application subnets due to a query performance bug we caught.
This new proposal therefore contains all changes from the previous release, a fix for the bug caught in the previous release attempt, and also changes since `3eaf8541c389badbd6cd50fff31e158505f4487d` until the 3rd of October, when the release candidate `b099ca45f21dc84d9f9dd6d14cc8cb4e7c00e3e1` was cut.
Weâ€™ll be going with a conservative release schedule (taking 2 weeks) due to the increased risk compared to regular releases.

Main changes: 
* Crypto: CSP, ed25519, and ECDSA improvements
* Execution: WebAssembly supports [bulk memory operations](https://github.com/WebAssembly/bulk-memory-operations). This release adds support for charging properly for such operations

* Execution: Updated Wasmtime version to 0.29
* Boundary nodes: adding http2_max_concurrent_streams 256;
