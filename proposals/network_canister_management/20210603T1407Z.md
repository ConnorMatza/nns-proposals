## Summary:

Updating NNS UI to a005f2d4e343a8eaecd6357a08172c3ef49cb3db

## Rationale:

* Automatic refreshing of neuron balances in the backend.
* Support for setting multiple controllers for a canister.
* UI enhancements

The wasm sha256 is
```
c2956cf0a86770e6efb5f352247e30fb603e17657210ac8cdf8fb982e2d39eff
```
as confirmed by a local build by me and by CI: https://github.com/dfinity/dfinity_wallet/runs/2735899101

The affected canister id is `qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai` and the desired install mode is `upgrade`.
