# Upgrade NNS Dapp to cb3759c

The wasm hash is `74ec0e87d35c20e768cca4bcc2163b217d05128468ec9d93c0b51fe121162944` and can be verified/downloaded [here](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/runs/3507922036?check_suite_focus=true).

## Changelog

* Support for merging neuron maturity.
* Support for managing neurons via the upcoming Ledger Nano hardware wallet integration. This includes staking neurons, disbursing neurons, spawning neurons, and adding/remove hotkeys.
* Improved error handling. Now, instead of seeing a spinner forever, the user is alerted if something goes wrong, with a clear error message indicating what went wrong.
* Various UI enhancements.
