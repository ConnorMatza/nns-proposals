Wasm hash: d1b8c88944fc46917f934ff1693db1e24f350eab094264df8d8a195f1fd4042f (https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/runs/3674402517)

## Change Log:

* Fix rendering issues on iOS 15
* Add endpoint to store stable assets that persist across upgrades, which will allow us to store assets beyong the 3MiB limit that we currently have.
* The previous upgrade, where we attempted to refactor accounts into a certifiable data structure, has failed. It's not clear yet the reason of the failure, and for now we've reverted these changes.
