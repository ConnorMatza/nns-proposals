This proposal is not intended to be adopted.
It is an invalid proposal to resolve ICSUP-1017.
This issue manifests as the Governance canister not being upgradeable if its "stable state" has shrunk in size since the last upgrade.
Thus, we need to make a couple of dummy proposals to grow its state.
These proposals will be voted down and rejected.
