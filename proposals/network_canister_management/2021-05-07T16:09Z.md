## Rationale:

We want to do the first upgrade of the identity canister on mainnet.

Mostly minor improvements (metrics, wording, performance). Also to practice this:
```
~/dfinity/idp-service $ git log --oneline --first-parent --since=2021-05-05 src/
756bca59 (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main) Sets up eslint (#236)
4cbf66b0 Refine wording on about page (#237)
8ebb0ce6 prune old signature on register (#235)
ec914996 optimization: use Cow<'static, Bytes> for HttpResponse body (#234)
48f68c7a chore: slightly improved compatibilityNotice (#228)
f976820c compute asset hashes at build time (#233)
5054b9ed Selenium tests: Device removal (#230)
7cf372bf rerender manage page on successful deletion (#231)
384d7769 Selenium: Mild refactor around `addVirtualAuthenticator` (#232)
71367fbf metrics: report stable memory size (#226)
d9973677 feat: aria-live, enter keys, and button border (#227)
33000ee7 chore: adding link to user guide to about (#222)
7c97a370 chore: reassuring message for construct identity screen (#224)
8318dd4a Add block timestamps to exported metrics (#220)
```
(next time weâ€™ll have a precise tag to compare to).

The wasm sha256 is `f43dfe544a2612ec3c4a0ee291fb4d69ccd01df5f2836c804619fe6a52a43ea0`, as confirmed by CI: https://github.com/dfinity/idp-service/runs/2528732162
