# Upgrade NNS Dapp canister to commit cd2e02a076e7b4e20e1429c6664916405f9976c1.

Wasm hash: 69e20c192567218e64a125c09dffc2f3ac9792d45478e61d55455002aa08f722 (https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/runs/3556853615)

## Change Log:

This update fixes an issue where neurons would not be displayed for some users due to their balances being less than 1 ICP (which is invalid and was causing the request to refresh their balances to fail). We will log in the console whenever a neuron falls into this category so that users can add enough ICP to these neurons to make them valid again.

This update also fixes an issue where newly disbursed neurons would still appear in the list of neurons after being disbursed.
