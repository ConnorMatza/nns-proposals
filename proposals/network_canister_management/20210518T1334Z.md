## Summary:

Updating Internet Identity to 93a2932

## Rationale:

We're updating the single device warning and make it easier to use on iOS in Safari. Additionally we're adding the ability to add a new device directly from the management page.

Detailed list of changes since last release:
```
~/code/internet-identity main
❯ git log --oneline --first-parent mainnet-20210518T0626Z..HEAD src/
93a2932 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) Adds a spacer to the bottom of the warning (#280)
9a51cb4 Allow adding new devices from the management page (#273)
7c5238b Update warning text (#278)
```

The wasm sha256 is

```
as confirmed by a local build by me and by CI: https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/runs/2610564203

The affected canister id is `rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai` and the desired install mode is `upgrade`.
