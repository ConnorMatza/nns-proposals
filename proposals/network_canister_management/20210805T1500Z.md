## Summary:

Updating Internet Identity to 4c821f6

## Rationale:

We're showing the user their pseudonym before authorizing the authentication.

Detailed list of changes since last release:
```
~/code/internet-identity main
❯ git log --oneline --first-parent mainnet-20210716T1530Z..HEAD src/
4c821f6 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) Show Application Principal ID during auth (#356)
```

The wasm sha256 is
```
6b7585b97c541f67d182eb7dcfa0a41e613e54dae29f1e719d85c7512bab03f0
```
as confirmed by a local build by me and by CI: https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/runs/3231907265

The affected canister id is `rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai` and the desired install mode is `upgrade`.
