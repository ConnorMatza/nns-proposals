# Network Nervous System (NNS) proposals for the Internet Computer

## The NNS

The NNS of the Internet Computer relies on user-generated proposals from the community which are voted on and executed on-chain. Users submit these proposals via the NNS UI or the `dfx` command line interface.

To make visibility, this repo is a public collection of proposals. It does not interact with the NNS directly, nor is this where proposals are submitted. To submit a proposal see NNS UI instructions.
